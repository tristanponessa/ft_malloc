THIS VERSION OF LIBFT IS NOT FINISHED
ITS A PROTOTYPE
ALL FUNCTIONS USE INT INSTEAD OF INTMAXT 
SOME FUNCTIONS HAVE LEAKS AND COULD BE WRITTEN SMALLER 


PHILOSOPHY : 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

all functions do their job, if you do something wrong undetermined behavour will happen
two types are very frequently dealt with : t_x (intmax_t)
                                            char
no void type is used , only t_x and char , t_vector is used to act like strings for integers, there's a int size like '\0'

arr convortors : you can't make an double array tab[0] : malloc(5) , tab[1] : (3) , tab[2] = malloc(7)
    you must pick generla sizes ex . (10,2) (5, 5) (y , x)
    except with ft_split that puts words into a double table

optimization is not the specialty of this libft , 
easier code use and lisibility is priority 

when refering to a integer type which is anything than char , the word integer is used
when refering to a string , other types arrays are refered as arr , strlen arrlen

all functions that are universal have ft_
static funtoins dont have   

FUNCTIONS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ft_counter : is a for loop. 
            everytime the version is changed, it starts at 0 again.

long_to_str : ft_atol_base / ft_ltoa_base
str_to_long
