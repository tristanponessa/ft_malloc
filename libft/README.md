# 42 libft
## My personal C library

* functions organised by foldiers
* objects thrown in a foldier
* personalized makefile state information

* vector c version (to avoid malloc and static) 
* has a for loop function (ft_counter)
* counter structure containing 8 counters
* str, memory, linked chains functions
* some double to single arrays converters
* some int to char converter
* a calculator (ft_do_op)
* home made printf and i/o functions
* some file reader, converter
* MANual prototype
* added typedefs for unsigned ,long long, intmax_t (t_uint , t_llong, t_x...)

COMING SOON
  
 * better calculator (evalexpr)
 * all converters possible
 * function that deals with mallocs and frees all of them
 * all malloc use functions will use the malloc manager functions
 * create a MANual
 * simpler version of printf
 * add get_next_line
 * create long long and intmax_t functions
 * random number function
